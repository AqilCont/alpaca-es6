## Quick tips

### Experimental top level await

I would personally use the `--experimental-top-level-await` tag with your node.js 14.3.0+ to allow for stuff like this:

```js
// Literally all you need from this api btw, ignore all the other classes
import { Client } from "alpaca-api";

const client = new Client({
  key: "your key id", secret: "your secret key" /** <- alpacas weird in it's naming schemes, and api access stuffs(like why have 2 keys lmao) ngl */
  auto: false, /** Auto-connects to sockets if true, but this checks for authentication as well so we don't want to do this yet :D */
});

// Yay it always confirms that you are able to connect with this, and just exits if you aren't
if(!await client.authenticated) {
  console.log("oh nu it doesn't work");
  process.exit();
}

// Connects and listens for events
client.connect().on("trade", console.log)

console.log("i think it works");
```

> returns `oh nu it doesn't work` btw

### Editor

This API was built using an editor like VSC, where you can easily see JSDoc comments and types usage. I would highly recommend this so you can get some quick docs straight in your editor, without looking at the website over and over!

## Installation

> Note: Node.js 14 required. I would recommend installing something like nvm(**n**ode **v**ersion **m**anager) to keep your node.js installation up-to-date.

```cmd
> npm i alpaca-api
```

## `alpaca.Client`

A client for handling all account based requests. Basically, the only useful thing to you, the consumer.

### `Client` Initialization

The standard way to initialize the client.

```ts
// Import the Client
import { Client } from 'alpaca-api'

// The actual initialization
const client = new Client({
  key: '...',
  secret: '...',
  paper: true,
  rate_limit: true,
})
```

You can also use environment variables which will be applied to every new
client.

```cmd
> set APCA_API_KEY_ID=yourKeyGoesHere
> set APCA_API_SECRET_KEY=yourKeyGoesHere
> set APCA_PAPER=true
```

### `Client` Properties

Things you can directly access from a `Client` instance.

#### `authenticated` => `Promise<boolean>`

Checks if the client is authenticated.

```typescript

...

if(await client.authenticated) {
  // do something i guess
}

...
```

#### `orders` => `Orders`

Orders class instance assigned to the current client. Holds the cache and other things.

```typescript
await client.orders.get('6187635d-04e5-485b-8a94-7ce398b2b81c');
```

### `Client` Methods

All Client instance methods.

#### `info()`

Gets some information about your Alpaca account.

```typescript
await client.info()
```

#### `portfolio([query])`

Gets your [portfolio history](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/portfolio-history/) on the Alpaca platform.

```js
// Just a small example of the parameter types, take a look at the JSDoc in a supported editor like VSC or a look at the link above for more info!
await client.portfolio({
  period: "1W", timeframe: "1H", date_end: "2020-10-10", extended_hours: true
})
```

#### `assets([opts])`

Gets the assets that are connected to your account. Filtered by the object `opts` provided. [API Reference](https://alpaca.markets/docs/api-documentation/api-v2/assets/).

```js
await client.assets({ id: "AAPL" });
```

## `alpaca.Stream`

An Alpaca WebSocket API for streamlining the exchange of requests and data to and from the Alpaca servers. We will mostly handle this for you, and I would advise from actually using the `send` method.

### Initialization

An API key is allowed 1 simultaneous connection to each server. Connecting to them is easy:

```ts
// Imports the Alpaca websocket stream API
import { Stream, urls: { market } } from 'alpaca-api';

// Creates a websocket stream
const stream = new Stream(client, market).connect();

// This subscribes to SPY's trade stream, and you can listen for it later
stream.subscribe(['T.SPY']);

// Will get called on each new trade event for SPY
stream.on("message", trade => console.log(trade));
```

### `Stream` Methods

Functions assigned to the `Stream` instance.

#### `Stream.send(message)`

> You will probably never use this, and please don't try to unless you know what you are doing. This is mostly used internally in alpaca.

- `message`: `<any>` The message to send
- Returns: The `Stream` instance

Sends a message to the websocket host.

```js
stream.send({ lmao: "i can put anything here!" })
```

#### `Stream.subscribe(stream)`

- `stream`: `<string | string[]>` Name of the stream you want to subscribe to
- **Returns:** The `Stream` instance(making it chainable)

Subscribes to an alpaca stream on the current connected websocket.

```js
stream.subscribe("T.AAPL");

// You can also do multiple
stream.subscribe(["T.AAPL", "T.SPY", "AM.AAPL"]);
```

#### `Stream.unsubscribe(stream)`

- `stream`: `<string | string[]>` Name of the stream you want to unsubscribe from.
- **Returns:** The `Stream` instance(making it chainable).

Unsubscribes to an already-subscribed stream.

```js
stream.unsubscribe("T.AAPL");

// You can also do multiple
stream.unsubscribe(["T.AAPL", "T.SPY", "AM.AAPL"]);
```

#### `Stream.connect()`

- **Returns:** The `Stream` instance(making it chainable)

Connects to the websocket, if you didn't enable "auto" in the options.

```js
stream.connect().subscribe("account_updates");
```

### `Stream` Events

All stream events, able to be listened to by `Stream.on("event-name", data => /* do something with "data" here */)`

#### Event `"message"`

- `data`: The data containing the message info.

Emitted whenever any method is received from the stream

```ts
stream.on("message", data => console.log(JSON.stringify(data)));
```

#### Event `"authentication"`

- `client`: The stream instance that got authenticated.

Emitted on client authentication from websocket server.

```ts
stream.on("authenticated", auth => console.log("YAY!! We got authenticated :D"))
```

## `alpaca.Market` extends `alpaca.stream`

Market data websocket :D

### `Market` Events

#### Event `"trade"`

- `data`: The original message

```js
client.market.on("trade", t => console.log("this trade happened:", t));
```

## `alpaca.urls`

Contains 2 properties used for securing a connection to an Alpaca websocket, and 2 others for account related APIs:

### `urls` Properties

All the urls xddd

#### `urls.account`

Basically contains all links related to your account

**Properties:**

- `urls.account.rest`: Rest API base URL
- `urls.account.stream`: WebSocket host URL
- `urls.account.paper`: Paper version of above links
  - `urls.account.paper.rest`: Paper version of the `urls.account.rest` link
  - `urls.account.paper.stream`: Paper version of the `urls.account.stream` link

#### `urls.market`

Contains all links related to market data.

**Properties:**

- `urls.market.rest`: REST API url
- `urls.market.stream`: URL for market data websocket
